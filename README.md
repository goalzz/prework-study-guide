# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- This Prework Study Guide project was created for boot camp students to be completed before the start of the course. 
-  Building this project was a great opportunity to get used to effective developer habits, practicing a growth mindset and more. This is like learning the first steps towards coding, with the best guidance provided by the boot camp.
- The application on its own is very simple, however it suggests us on learning key points about HTML, CSS, GIT and JavaScript.
- Out of all three modules that I had to go through to build this project, the most important things (for me) to learn were: setting up SSH keys, completing git flow - pull requests, raising issues and closing them.

Each section contains notes about a certain topic, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. If we open the DevTools console (Command+Option+I for macOS or Control+Shift+I for Windows), we can see the JavaScript running. Here you will see the list of topics from the prework and it will suggest one topic for us to study first.
